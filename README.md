Generic Android App base code
=============================

This is the skeleton for a first android app. You can use it for your new projects. Just clone it to your new directory and you will have a new NetBeans project to start with.

It provides a main page. An options menu and a preferences page.

Also, an about page.

Please send me back comments for future improvements.
